<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a mechanical engineer, designer, educator and entrepreneur that likes to make ideas into reality and teach
  others how to do it. My main focus is on robotics and computer integration. I believe our future is very much heading
  towards a version of I,Robot and technology of this nature will be very important up ahead. Through this focus, I've
  learned computer code and how to build webistes which is the reason why I'm building this site. To everyone out there, 
  I leave you with a few words that I believe are important. If you are alive, you are absorbing
  new information everyday, therefore you are capable of learning no matter what, therefore you are able to make your own
  success. So, learn something new everyday!</p>
